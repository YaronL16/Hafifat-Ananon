# The hitchiker's guide to the CTS

This is the training course for the CTS trainees.

### Requirements for completing the course successfully:
1. The trainee must complete all the subjects listed in the syllabus.
2. The trainee must present **at least** 1 presentation on a selected topic.
3. The trainee must pass at both a midterm exam and a final exam.


### Few notes:
- This repository is for the instructor and not for the trainee.
- Letting the trainee look up information by himself (rather than taking an online course) is highly encouraged.
- An instructor that feels that his trainee could benefit from additional topics is encouraged to touch on them **in addition** to the required topics.
