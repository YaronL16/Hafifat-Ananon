### Goals

- The trainee will understand what is LVM
- The trainee will understand how to use LVM related commands
- The trainee will understand how to create and manage LVM

### Tasks
- Read about:
  - Phisical volumes
  - Volume groups
  - Logical volumes
  - Phisical extents
  - Logical extents
  - Device mapPEr

- Give three ways to list the following:
  - All LVs
  - All VGs
  - All PVs
- Create an LV out of two diffrent disks 
- Create a fiLEsystem on the LV you've created 
- Add a disk to your machine and extend the VG and the LV you've created
- Reduce the size of the LV without harming the fiLEsystem
- Reduce the size of the VG
- Add another disk to your machine and move the data from one of the PVs to the new disk
- Then remove everything from the top down (remove the LV then the VG and then the PV)
- Draw a drawing that explains the layers of an LVm including PEs and LEs
- Explain how does the logical volume know how to find all the data chuncks related to it
